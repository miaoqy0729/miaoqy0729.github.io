*social neuroscience* \| *multimodal communication* \| *human-AI relations*

I’m a Ph.D. Candidate in Cognitive and Computational Communication at [UCLA](https://comm.ucla.edu/person/grace-qiyuan-miao/), supervised by Prof. [Rick Dale](https://comm.ucla.edu/person/rick-dale-2/), Prof. [Matthew Lieberman](https://www.uclascnlab.com/people), Prof. [Tanya Stivers](https://sites.google.com/g.ucla.edu/tanya-stivers/home), and Prof. [Francis Steen](https://comm.ucla.edu/person/francis-steen/).

How do people form meaningful connections, both with other humans and with artificial intelligence? How does the brain distinguish between deep and shallow interactions? How can we better interpret human dynamics—neural, behavioral, and conversational—to inform practical interventions? These questions drive my PhD research as I seek to understand and address the increasingly prevalent and dangerous social phenomenon of the [loneliness epidemic](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/magazine/loneliness-epidemic-cure.html).

My work utilizes **naturalistic experiments**, **computational methods**, and **qualitative conversation analysis** to explore the <u>multifaceted nature of human interactions</u>, encompassing its **neural**, **behavioral**, **social**, and **linguistic** dimensions. To find out more, please check out the [Research](/research/) page.

As a **passion-driven** researcher with a love for **meaningful connections**, I strive to **bridge the longstanding divide** between qualitative and quantitative methods to decode the mystery behind <u>human connections, vibes, and relationships</u>--ultimately addressing the <u>loneliness epidemic</u>. To learn more about this endeavor, please check out the [DIMS Conference](/dims/) I host, which **brings together experts** to explore dynamic interactions and methodologies in this field.

In my free time, I love snowboarding, food tasting, aerial silking, cooking, and traveling. I’ve snowboarded at various ski resorts in California, Utah, Colorado, and Alaska, and I went to Santiago, Chile for fresh powder in August!
